# Modules and pips

#Modules are just a python file that we can import into our own python file

#If it has important functions and variables, then we can access by adding to our own python file

import useful_tools #<-- This is the python file

#call file then put . to access the variables and functions

print(useful_tools.roll_dice(10))


#Free list of modules:

#https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

#These are all external modules that we don't have to download, but already come as libraries in our python downloaded folder

#If you want something other than those just search it up online and download it using instructions

#Pip is your package manager, and you can download python modules through that
